# Tibiantis Helper

Makes life a bit easier for us retrocore noobs on Tibiantis :)

This is an app made to streamline the Tibiantis experience, centralizing a lot of information and useful features into one easy-to-use platform that runs neatly in your traybar. It works by parsing data from the Cipsoft 7.7 server leak (which for reasons ended up becoming public domain) which I've modified to reflect 7.4 better.

Make sure to try right-clicking / double clicking things in the various lists! And the tray icon.

**Do note that I have not yet removed all the 7.7 items!** While it is very easy to modify the data it is still quite laborious to do manually, so for upcoming updates I will prioritize removing just the main category items (armors, weapons and such). The goal will to have it perfectly reflect 7.4 by version 1.0, but for now I wanted to just put out a "good enough" pre-release since people seemed to want it.

If you have any issues or ideas for improvement, feel free to contact me on Discord! (-o-#8184)

## Installing

The program must be in the same folder as Tibiantis.spr and Tibiantis.dat found in the "game" folder in the Tibiantis client. Just to keep things clean I'd recommend making a separate folder for Tibiantis Helper somewhere and just copy those files over (there will be a prompt to browse for those files if you run the program). Alternatively you can just put the helper directly in the game folder.

I wrote this whole thing with a broken keyboard. Backspace is not working and I cannot describe to you the depths of my suffering
